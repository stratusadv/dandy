# Read This First

Our documentation is here to help you understand all the critical parts of Dandy and get you discovering all the cool features that are available.

Take some time to read the couple sections below as they will provide you with information that will make it easier to learn how to use Dandy.

## Pydantic = Friend!

We have a class called `BaseIntel` that directly inherits from the pydantic `BaseModel` class.
This class has extended functionality and naming to give more separation of concerns between Dandy code and your code.

!!! tip

    Pydantic is an amazing library that makes handling data in python much easier.
    Every developer should take time to learn the basics and understand how pydantic can benefit your project.

Dandy critically relies on the use of pydantic like objects to handle the flow and validation of data with your artificial intelligence systems. 
Make sure you have a good foundation on the use of pydantic before continuing.
