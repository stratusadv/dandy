## Purpose

Make AI development as deterministic as possible while empowering the probabilistic nature of intelligence.

## Yet Another AI Framework?

Intelligence programming is a very different experience than conventional programming as it's very probabilistic.
Based on our experience most of the existing frameworks / libraries are designed to focus more on deterministic outcomes which is not realistic or in our opinion, or beneficial to developers. 

We created Dandy to focus on the flow and validation of data with your artificial intelligence systems to allow you to embrace the probabilistic nature of intelligence.

It's opinionated, simple and designed to be incredibly pythonic putting the project and developers first.
Our approach is to focus on batteries included with strong tooling to help build great interactions and lowering the barrier to entry.

## Pillars of Dandy

- __Simple as it Can Be__ - Intelligence programming is complex by nature, and we want Dandy to get out of your way as much as possible.
- __Pythonic__ - We want everything Dandy can do to be as pythonic as possible leaving the developer to focus on their own code.
- __Opinionated__ - Our goal is to provide as many of the answers as possible along with working solutions that allow developers to focus on maintaining their agency while being informed.
- __Developer First__ - All features added to Dandy must make the developer's life easier and reduce complexity.
- __Batteries Included__ - Dandy comes with batteries included with strong tooling to help build great interactions and lowers the barrier to entry for developers.
- __Scalable__ - Every design choice in Dandy is about the future and making sure developers can scale their projects as needed.
