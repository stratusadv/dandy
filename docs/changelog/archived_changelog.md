# Archived Changelog

## v0.20.0

### Features

- LLM Agents
  - Dandy now supports agentic processing through the `LlmAgent` module located in `dandy.llm`.
  - Works very similarly to a `LlmBot` but requires `processors` attribute that is a sequence of `BaseProcessor` subclasses.
  - All `processors` must have a `description` attribute to tell the agent how to use them and when.

### Fixes

- Fixed a bug on `LlmBot` that prevented you from using the `intel_object` argument in the `process` method.
- `BaseProcessor` method `process` now maintains it's signature properly.

## v0.18.0

### Breaking

- `BaseListIntel` now works by creating a single attribute in the subclass that must be typed as a list.

### Features

- The `BaseLlmMap` class now has a new required attribute `map_keys_description` that drastically improves accuracy.

### Changes

- On the `BaseLlmMap.process` the argument `choice_count` was renamed to `max_return_values` to make it more clear what it does and is now optional.
- The `BaseListIntel` now requires you to set the type of the `items` class variable with a type hint.

### Fixes

- Changed `Prompt` into a dataclass to allow typing with `BaseIntel`, `BaseListIntel` and `BaseModel`.
- Fixed a problem with the way `BaseLlmMap` was prompting for single responses using `max_return_values=1`.
- `LlmService` has been refactored to handle retrying and progressive exceptions much better.

## v0.17.0

### Features

- Added a new `calculator` module to dandy to help solve math problems related to using `Dandy`.
  - In `dandy.calculator.llm_calculator` you can find `model_size_for_inference_to_vram_gb` and `model_size_and_token_count_for_inference_to_vram_gb`
- There is a quick shortcut in the dandy cli to `model_size_and_token_count_for_inference_to_vram_gb` using the -c flag.

## v0.16.0

### Features

- Added a new `MessageHistory` class that can be used to submit a history of messages to be used in the request prompt.

### Fixes
