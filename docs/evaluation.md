#Evaluation

## Focus

---

### Opinionated

We want to follow what we think makes the most sense first then match that with industry terms.

This is a new category of software, and we need to be making stride to help our selves understand it.

### Batteries Included

Provide as much as possible for people to just get going on the tooling without having to put extra effort for tools.

### Magical

Small interface with large under the hood handling focusing on productivity and less on customization.

### Structured

Applications built with dandy should follow a specific structure and adapt well to other existing application structures.

## Landscape

---

### Intent and Natural Language Processing

At the current moment AI Models are too slow to handle rapid intent and natural language processing to be effective.

They should be part of the work flow as they will speed up drastically over the next couple of years.

Also their capability to provide more context versus conventional tooling will be much better.

### Database Usage

Using a database over a network with a synchronous agentic workflow won't be feasible to for active engagements.

Estimated Database Transaction Speed: 20 - 50ms (Over a Network)

An agentic workflow with 50 interactions would take an additional 2,500ms.

Bulk changes, in memory and semi asynchronous work flow would be required to mitigate this.

In memory or local DB storage would be also a big advantage.

### Token Processing

Our Estimates on token handling at a moderate speed (sub 2 seconds) and widely available to consumers.

- 2023: 2-4k 
- 2024: 4-8k
- 2025: 8-16k
- 2026: 32-128k
- 2027: 256-1024k
- 2028: 2-5m

A book has about 100,000 words which is about 125,000 tokens roughly. 
This would mean processing a book at a reasonable time won't be widely available until 2026-2027.
