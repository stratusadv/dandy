# Start Here

This tutorial will take you through our [Example](https://github.com/stratusadv/dandy/tree/main/example) project that will show you how to build a book generator.

## Before You go Any Further

Make sure you have completely gone through the [Getting Started](../index.md) section of the documentation.
It's very important that all the concepts are well understood before you start using Dandy as it's a very opinionated framework.

## Main

Check out the main file of our example project this is a good example of an entry point into Dandy.
