# Dandy Overview

## Description üöÄ

Dandy is an open-source framework designed to facilitate the creation of intelligent interactions across diverse resources. Our goal is to simplify the integration of artificial intelligence systems, making the process as intuitive and Pythonic as possible.

### Key Features:

- **Bots for Prompt Handling**: Utilize bots to convert user prompts into a structured format, enhancing interaction with LLM APIs.
  
- **Intels Schema Management**: Leverage [pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/) classes called "intels" for managing the flow and validation of data in AI systems. These schemas ensure that your interactions are robust and error-free.

- **Dynamic API Calls**: Integrate dynamic data conversion and intelligent workflow management to optimize token usage, enabling more efficient API calls.

- **Customizable Data Fields**: Easily include or exclude specific fields from intels sent to LLM APIs, allowing for flexible and tailored interactions.

- **Exception Handling**: Benefit from a suite of built-in exceptions designed to handle common errors and facilitate the creation of high-quality context data.

- **Development Tools**: Enhance your AI development experience with a set of tools that streamline the process of building intelligent systems.

- **Bots**: Use bots to handle prompts and convert them into a structured format for LLM APIs.

Dandy empowers developers to build sophisticated AI applications with ease, ensuring seamless and efficient interactions with large language models. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just starting out, Dandy provides the tools you need to harness the power of artificial intelligence effectively. üõ†Ô∏èüí°
